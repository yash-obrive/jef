          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Measurement</strong> is the first step in any power system study. Measurement is the process of collecting data about the system. It is important to accurately measure key parameters such as voltage, current, power, and energy to properly assess the system status. This data can come from sensors, meters, and other sources. In any power system, be it a distribution network, a transmission network, or even a microgrid, these studies collect data about the current state of a power system issues which is needed to understand its behavior. This data can be used to validate models and simulations, or it can be analyzed directly to assess risk. Many different types of measurements can be taken in a power system such as voltage, power, and circuit measurements, and each type of measurement will provide valuable information about the system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simulation</strong> is another important tool that is often used in conjunction with measurement in power system studies. Simulations allow for the testing of different scenarios without having to physically modify the system, which can save time and money. They also allow for a greater level of control over experimentation, as it is possible to change variables and test different combinations of conditions more easily than would be possible in the real world. These studies use computer models to simulate the behaviour of power systems under different conditions. This allows for the power system studies software to analyze a wider range of scenarios than is possible with measurements alone.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Validation</strong> is the process of comparing the predictions made by the model to actual measurements made on the system. This comparison can be used to assess the accuracy of the model and improve it if necessary. Validation ensures that the results of the simulation accurately represent reality. There are many different ways to validate power system models. One common method is to compare the results of the model to actual measurements from the power system. This can be done by comparing voltage and current measurements from sensors in the power system to the corresponding values predicted by the model. If there is a good agreement between the two, then it can be said that the model is accurate. By comparing the results of multiple simulations, it is possible to get a more accurate picture of what is happening in the power system. In general, validation is an important step in any scientific study.

LOTO is a safety procedure that involves locking or tagging equipment and disconnecting it from its power source before maintenance or repair work begins. This procedure helps prevent accidental electrical shocks and electrocution.</li>
          <li><strong>Explosion-proof equipment:</strong> According to a research of 2020, explosions were associated with 71% of incidents, which resulted in 89% of fatalities in the pharmaceutical industry across 2018 and 2019. In hazardous areas, explosion-proof electrical equipment, such as switches, lights, and wiring, should be used to prevent sparks that could ignite flammable substances.</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency response planning:</strong> A fire safety plan should be in place to prevent and respond to fires. This plan should include fire extinguishers, emergency exits, evacuation routes, and employee training. Additionally, chemical and pharmaceutical industries should conduct regular emergency drills and simulations to test their emergency response procedures. The aim is to ensure that workers are adequately trained and prepared to handle electrical accidents and are well aware of all electrical safety protocols. These drills should cover all aspects of electrical safety, including power outages, electrical fires, and electrocution.</li>
          <li><strong>Electrical equipment maintenance:</strong> Chemical and pharmaceutical industries should conduct regular inspections and audits of their electrical systems and equipment to identify and rectify potential hazards, faulty equipment, and improper installation before they result in accidents. Electrical equipment, including motors, switches, and cables, should be routinely maintained, repaired, and replaced, as necessary, to prevent malfunctions and reduce the risk of electrical fires and explosions.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance with industry standards and regulations:</strong> Chemical and pharmaceutical industries must comply with electrical safety regulations and guidelines set by government agencies and industry standards organizations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Compliance with these standards helps to prevent accidents and ensure that equipment is maintained and inspected according to recommended procedures. These codes and standards outline the minimum requirements for the safe design, installation, and operation of electrical systems and equipment.</li>
          <li><strong>Clean and organized workplace:</strong> Keeping the workplace clean and organized can help prevent accidents caused by electrical hazards. Electrical equipment should be kept clean and debris-free, and the workplace should be organized to avoid tripping risks. Moreover, all electrical equipment, wiring, and hazards should be labelled to ensure that employees are aware of potential dangers.</li>
          <li><strong>Reporting near-misses and incidents:</strong> Encouraging employees to report near-misses and incidents can help identify potential hazards and prevent accidents. Near misses could have resulted in an accident but were avoided due to timely intervention. Reporting of such incidents should be encouraged and followed up to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          By implementing these additional steps, chemical and pharmaceutical industries can further improve their electrical safety measures and prevent workplace accidents. It is essential to continually assess and improve safety practices to ensure a safe working environment for all employees.

          Lightning occurs when huge amounts of static electricity stored in wet clouds are released. The positive charges in the ground attract the negative charges in the wet clouds, and lightning strikes the path of least resistance, such as tall structures. As an act of nature, there is no known way of preventing lightning from occurring, and with the rapidly changing climate, the number of lightning strikes has been increasing in recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being uncontrollable and unpredictable, lightning strikes can cause significant damage to people, homes, and businesses. The only way to protect people and property from severe damage is to be prepared beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a study conducted on Lightning Fires and Lightning Strikes between 2007–2011, lightning fires cause $451 million in property damage each year in the USA alone, before the impact of global warming. It is easy to imagine that the extent of damage that can be caused by lightning is huge.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Preparation is Key</h3>
          <p>
            Preparation is where lightning protection systems play a huge role. Earthing, or grounding, i.e., creating a connection between an earth electrode made of highly resistant material and electrical equipment, serves as a protector against lightning strikes. The earthing and grounding systems provide an alternate route for the current to flow, thereby absorbing the shock to mitigate the damage.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">There is a three-pronged approach to ensuring that your facility is well-protected against a hit:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2 mt-2">
            <li>There is an earth ground plan in the facility.</li>
            <li>All the instruments and electrical components are properly grounded.</li>
            <li>Surge protection is taken care of.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-4">Another important point to consider is to ensure that the plan is meticulous, and the equipment is of the best quality.</p>

According to this standard, lightning protection is not only required to protect the structure and the people around it but also the electrical and electronic equipment inside the structure from the surge caused by such strikes. This can be done by using SPD and radiated surges using Faraday cage-type LPS. A risk assessment methodology is needed to determine the level of protection required for any structure and the electronics it holds.

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-8 text-white/80 font-light leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The Shree Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya is not just a place of worship — it is a landmark of national pride, built to stand for centuries. When the temple trust began planning its infrastructure, they made an extraordinary demand: the lightning protection system had to be twice as powerful as anything the global standards required.
        </p>

        <p>
          That challenge landed on JEF's desk. What followed was a first in the history of lightning protection engineering worldwide.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Why Lightning Protection at This Scale?</h3>

        <p>
          Lightning protection systems are rated by the magnitude of impulse current they can safely conduct. The international benchmark, as defined by IEC 62305, is 100kA — the standard that governs protection design for critical structures across the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Ram Mandir Trust wanted more. Their mandate: protect the temple at 200kA, an energy level four times higher than what any commercially available lightning protection or earthing product in the world was designed to handle.
        </p>

        <p>
          This wasn't an incremental upgrade. It was a leap into entirely uncharted engineering territory.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">The Challenge: No Product in the World Qualified</h3>

        <p>
          When JEF's team assessed the requirement, a hard truth emerged — no manufacturer anywhere had a complete, type-tested range of components rated for 200kA lightning impulse current. Not in Europe. Not in the United States. Not in Asia.
        </p>

        <p>
          Type-testing is not a formality. It means subjecting every component — air terminals, down conductors, earthing electrodes, connectors — to internationally accredited laboratory testing at the exact impulse current rating they will be expected to handle in the field.
        </p>

        <p>
          A system is only as strong as its weakest link, and every link had to be tested.
        </p>

        <p>
          JEF had two options: source components that didn't exist or build them.
        </p>

        <p>They chose to build them.</p>

        <hr />

        <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">India-Made, Europe-Tested: The Engineering Response</h3>

        <p>
          JEF's engineering team designed and developed an entirely new range of lightning protection and earthing components capable of withstanding 200kA impulse current. These products were:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
          <li>
            Designed and manufactured in India, aligned with the government's Make in India vision
          </li>
          <li>
            Type-tested by European certification bodies, meeting and surpassing IEC standard requirements
          </li>
          <li>
            Sequentially tested as a complete system — not just individual components in isolation
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This last point is critical. Sequential type-testing means every component in the system was tested in the order and manner in which it would perform under a real lightning event. It is the most rigorous form of product validation in the industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result: the world's first complete range of sequentially type-tested 200kA lightning protection system components — developed, built, and proven in India.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">What Makes 200kA So Different?</h3>

        <p>
          To appreciate the engineering achievement, consider what the numbers actually mean.
        </p>

        <p>
          A standard IEC 100kA system is designed for Level I protection — the highest classification under the international standard. The energy released by a 200kA lightning strike is not twice as much; because energy scales with the square of current, it is four times the energy of a 100kA event.
        </p>

        <p>
          That means every component — every clamp, every conductor, every earth electrode — must absorb and dissipate four times the thermal and mechanical stress compared to a standard Level I system. Materials, cross-sections, connection methods, and grounding depth all had to be re-engineered from the ground up.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">A Project Portfolio That Prepared JEF for This Moment</h3>

          JEF did not arrive at the Ram Mandir project without a foundation. Over three decades of protecting India's most critical infrastructure had sharpened the team's capabilities:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
          <li>
            Statue of Unity — the world's tallest statue, requiring precision lightning risk assessment and protection design
          </li>
          <li>
            Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad — the world's largest cricket stadium
          </li>
          <li>
            Kempegowda International Airport, Terminal 2, Bengaluru — a modern infrastructure landmark
          </li>
          <li>
            Dozens of industrial facilities, petrochemical plants, power stations, and data centres across India and internationally
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each project brought unique challenges. The Ram Mandir brought them all together — heritage significance, structural sensitivity, extreme performance requirements, and the eyes of a nation.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">The Outcome: A System Built to Last Centuries</h3>

        <p>
          The completed lightning and earthing protection system at the Shree Ram Janmabhoomi Temple delivers protection that no other building in the world currently has — a fully type-tested, 200kA-rated system, designed to safeguard the temple and its occupants for generations.
        </p>

        <p>
          For JEF, this project is more than a portfolio entry. It is a milestone that redefines what Indian engineering can achieve — and a standard that others will now aspire to meet.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">What This Means for the Industry</h3>

        <p>
          The development of 200kA type-tested components has opened a new frontier in high-risk lightning protection. Industries where the consequences of a direct lightning strike are catastrophic — oil and gas refineries, ammunition depots, nuclear facilities, heritage structures, mission-critical data centres — now have a validated, tested solution available from an Indian manufacturer.
        </p>

        <p>
          The engineering work done for Ayodhya has created a product range that is available for any project that demands protection beyond what global standards currently define.

          Lightning discharges are of very high energy and can have devastating effects depending on the path of its discharge. Lightning strike is not predictable and is a random phenomenon both from the aspect of its occurrence and intensity or the energy discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assessing the risk caused by lightning is a complex process because the likelihood that your facility will be facing a lightning strike depends on several factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, we all know that lightning can cause severe damages to human lives, historical monuments, industrial buildings/structures, and whatnot! There is a high possibility that the electrical/electronic equipment inside these buildings/structures might also be at risk. The only way to find that out, to do a LIGHTNING RISK ASSESSMENT for your building/structure! For any household or business structure, use our free lightning risk assessment calculator. The lightning risk calculator is used to estimate the cost of installations in power systems and lightning applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          To perform all the calculations manually and to arrive at the risk level might be a tedious task. You will need an expert to perform the task and you will have to invest both your time and money for the same. To make this task incredibly easy for you, we, at JEF, have come up with an automated tool to perform your RISK ASSESSMENT within seconds.

          Power Systems in hospital facilities are particularly vulnerable given the sudden increase in nonlinear electronic loads comprising of ventilators, diagnostic imaging equipment, Patient monitors and many bio medical devices – a crucial defense aid in fighting COVID. With improper electrical systems, further marred by non-compliance to electrical standards and poor workmanship, hospitals are staring at the high risk of overheating their electrical installation that could provoke fire.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Fire Causes:</h3>
          <p>
            Faulty electrical outlets and old, outdated equipment are the leading causes of electrical fires. Never use a device with a broken or damaged cable because it can cause a fire by sending heat to flammable surfaces including floors, drapes, and carpets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Fire prevention:</h3>
          <p>
            Around a socket, light switch, or light fixture, there may be burn marks or discoloration. When you touch an appliance, an outlet, or a power wire, it feels warm. When an object is plugged in or in operation, it emits a burning odor. When you plug in a gadget, electrical sparks appear. Each time you plug in a gadget, you get an electric jolt.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Reason: Electrical fires causes and prevention</h3>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Poor electrical wiring and cabling</h4>
              <p>Power-hungry electrical equipment such as MRI, CT Scans, and X-Ray machines, Ventilators and other medical devices, used in hospitals need uninterrupted power supply. A durable cable network is thus absolutely essential to carry this power supply without overheating.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Faulty electrical installations in an oxygen-rich environment</h4>
              <p>Areas such as operation theaters and ICUs have a high concentration of oxygen. Any electrical short circuit in these areas, could lead to electrical shock to surgeons or patients. In order to achieve uninterrupted power, or for surge control, UPS systems are used which are supported by batteries.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Increased use of flammable alcohol-based sanitizers</h4>
              <p>With the addition of Ventilators, air-conditioners, high-capacity machines in the ICUs, testing facilities for COVID, the addition of more rooms, and increased use of flammable alcohol-based sanitizers or PPE kits, risks of fire are only going higher. Add to it the poorly designed power systems built with even poorer workmanship, it all works like oxygen to start an electrical fire and feed it further.</p>

          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Ensure compliance to building codes for safety and reliability</h4>
              <p>Hospitals that use several non-linear loads and sensitive electronics alongside heavy-duty air conditioners and heaters, other large or small medical testing instruments, and are therefore always at the risk of poor power quality. While the first responsibility to ensure compliance to building codes for safety and reliability rests with designers.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Electrical & Fire Safety Audit</h4>
              <p>Proper maintenance and monitoring of Power Quality on an ongoing basis is important. With rising number of electrical fires in hospitals, several state and regulatory agencies have ordered a fire audit of the facilities. While a proactive fire audit of the COVID hospitals is a welcome move, the fire audits are testing the ability of the facility to protect itself from the fire, if it were to occur, not prevent the fire.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Wire your electrical networks right</h4>
              <p>Poor quality cables could lead to a serious fire incident at a hospital. It is vital that attention be paid to the wiring in the entire health facility. The global norm is to use 'Low Smoke and Zero Halogen (LSOH) wiring. However, in India, Flame Retardant Low Smoke (FRLS) wires are used widely. Reports suggest that these wires may not necessarily help avoid fire incidents completely.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">The ventilation system</h4>
              <p>The ventilation system in a hospital also has a role to play in this scenario. If the hospital is air-conditioned, an efficient mechanical ventilation system must be installed to avoid electrical fires from spreading.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Pay attention to earthing</h4>
              <p>A common practice in the Indian setup is to use separate earthing connections for all the electronic medical or non-medical equipment, but it is unjustified. All conductive metal in an equipotential area should be connected to a common equipotential earthing point with a special heavy-duty cable. This reduces the possibility of leakage currents that can cause micro electrocution when the surgeon or patient comes into contact with the equipment.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Ensuring good Power Quality to prevent electrical fire</h4>
              <p>
                There are several tools to proactively identify the vulnerabilities in power systems, including power quality issues, much before they lead to extreme events of electrical fire. Thermal Imaging is highly helpful in understanding the potential overheating in the electrical network. Periodic measurements and monitoring of harmonic distortion helps in early identification and prevention of heating in the electrical cables.

          Solar power from the sun represents a remarkable step towards green energy. But as advancement goes on in the installation of solar power, there arises a serious challenge: lightning protection for such assets. At JEF Techno Solutions, we offer specialized Lightning Protection Systems that protect the solar plants from devastating damage for smooth and efficient operation.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">The Vulnerability of Solar Plants to Lightning Strikes</h3>
          <p>
            Solar panels that are typically installed on open spaces and elevated surfaces are inherently at higher risks of getting struck by lightning. The metal framework, electrical components, and large cabling provide a tempting route for high-voltage lightning currents. Without protection, a lightning strike alone results in:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2 mt-2">
            <li>Permanent damage of photovoltaic (PV) modules</li>
            <li>Destruction of inverters and vital electrical components</li>
            <li>Prolonged operational downtime</li>
            <li>Costly repairs or full replacement</li>
            <li>Risk of Fire Hazards</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Common Causes of Damage by Lightning to Solar Plants</h3>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Direct Striking:</h4>
              <p>Lightning striking the mounting structures or directly hitting the solar panels produces mechanical and electrical damage.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Induced Surges:</h4>
              <p>Without a direct hit, electromagnetic pulses from close strikes cause electrical wiring to experience induced surges.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Ground Potential Rise (GPR):</h4>
              <p>When lightning hits the ground, ground voltage can be increased by the lightning and cause unsafe potential differences within a plant.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-white font-semibold mb-1">Backflash:</h4>
              <p>If a close-by object (such as a tower or tree) gets hit by lightning, lightning may return along the ground or interconnected networks back towards the solar plant.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Why Solar Plants Need Lightning Arrestors</h3>
          <p>Lightning arrestors, or surge protection devices (SPDs), are crucial pieces of equipment that reroute dangerous high-voltage surges away from the sensitive equipment. The main purposes of installing lightning arrestors at solar plants are:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2 mt-4">
            <li><strong>Asset protection:</strong> Avoiding expensive damage to panels, inverters, monitoring systems and batteries.</li>

          According to India's National Crime Records Bureau, electrocution deaths reached 12,918 in 2022, with 1,221 deaths and 1,486 injuries specifically on account of electrical fire incidents caused by short circuits. That's roughly 35 lives lost daily to basic electrical faults.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is extremely important that all the protective devices such as circuit breakers and fuses in your power distribution system should trip on time in the event of an over load or electrical faults such as short circuits. In case the circuit breakers or fuses do not trip on time, the consequences can be severe leading to thermal & mechanical damages to the electrical equipment, fires, explosions and even electrical shocks to the operating personnel. Also it can lead to voltage instability, power outages and significant financial losses.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is recommended that tests are conducted on the protective devices at regular intervals to check whether they will trip on time in case of an overload or electrical fault. These tests reveal the status/condition of the entire circuit loop starting from the power source, the protective device, the load, connecting cables and the earthing system in totality.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, protective devices play a crucial role in maintaining the safety and reliability of the electrical systems and in turn the entire warehouse facility. Their failure to operate on time during fault conditions can have serious and far-reaching consequences.

        <p>
          Lightning is the most natural phenomenon occurring in nature. All of us encounter lightning very often. Especially if the location is more prone to thunderstorm, lightning is quite obvious! And we all know that lightning can cause severe damages to human lives, historical monuments, industrial buildings/structures and what not!! There is a high possibility that the electrical/electronic equipment inside these buildings/structures might also be at risk. The only way to find that out is, to do a RISK ASSESSMENT for your building/structure!
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want to manually calculate your risk for any particular building/structure, then you have to follow all the steps and formulae given in IS/IEC 62305-2. This particular part exclusively talks about performing lightning risk assessment for any application of your choice. Be it your house, office, mall, industry etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          To perform all the calculations manually and to arrive at the risk level might be a tedious task. You will need an expert to perform the task. You will have to invest both your time and money for the same. To make this task incredibly easy for you, we, at JEF, has come up with a software to perform your RISK ASSESSMENT! This is an automated software which is built based on the formulae given in IS/IEC 62305-2. The MOST EXCITING thing about our software is you can perform the entire risk assessment and even generate the "Bill of Materials" & "Report" within 5 minutes!!
        </p>

        <p>
          The essential benefit of our software is that it performs both internal and external lightning risk assessments parallelly and continuously executes risk assessments from level 4 to level 1, providing the best techno-commercial solution. The software even avoids the human error that may occur when you are calculating the risk manually. Level 4 is the minimum level of protection and level 1 being the highest level of safety. The cost increases almost four times from level 4 to level 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          We call this software <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/JEF_SHIELD/login.php" className="underline">JEF SHIELD</a>. The working premise of JEF SHIELD is that it identifies the risk, analyses it, and then determines your RISK LEVEL. And it can be found on <strong>www.jeftechno.com!</strong>
        </p>
        <img src="/BlogImg/blog-9.1.png" alt="JEF SHIELD" className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg"  loading="lazy" />

        <p>
          All you have to do is give ACCURATE input data as and when it asks. Your risk assessment results are solely dependent on your INPUT DATA. More the accuracy of your input data, more the accuracy of your risk level!
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Input Data includes around 20-25 crucial parameters which mainly includes:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li>Location in which the building/structure is present</li>
            <li>Length, Width & Height of the building/structure</li>
            <li>Details of power & telecom lines</li>
            <li>Type of floor, number of floors in the building/structure</li>
            <li>Risk of fire</li>
            <li>Total number of people in the building/structure & functional hours etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Once the input data is given, our JEF SHIELD performs the risk assessment in the back-end. You can generate the risk assessment report and bill of materials within 2 minutes and download the same for your reference.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>ISN'T THAT SO COOL? BOTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY IS SAVED BIG TIME!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Sitting in any corner of the world, you can perform risk assessment for any structure/building and have the results within minutes!! So, next time you have any requirement to perform lightning risk assessment for any kind of buildings/structures, <strong>REMEMBER OUR JEF SHIELD!</strong>

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-8 text-white/80 font-light leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Let us quickly give you a basic idea about designing a Lightning Protection System, here are 7 important points.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">1. Accurate Data Collection</h3>
          <p>
            Accurate data plays a crucial role in designing a lightning protection system and is the essential deciding factor in the later stage of the design. Therefore, the invaluable data to be collected involves dimensions, location, and environmental components of the building/structure. If the data is approximate or wrong, the recommendation will reflect the same.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">2. What do you do with the "Accurate Data" that you have collected?</h3>
          <p>
            The next crucial step is to do a <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/jef-shield-tool" className="underline">RISK ASSESSMENT!</a> It decides whether a building requires external LPS, SPDs, or both, or whether no protection is needed. If protection is necessary, calculate the level of risk using the data collected as the input in our JEF SHIELD — an automated software built as per IS/IEC 62305-2.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">3. Arriving at the Level of Protection</h3>
          <p>If you do the risk assessment properly by giving accurate data, then be confident that your level of protection is correct! Here there are few possibilities:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2 mt-2">
            <li>Whether the building/structure needs External Protection (LPS).</li>
            <li>Whether the building/structure needs Internal Protection (SPDs).</li>
            <li>Whether the building/structure needs both Internal & External Protection.</li>
            <li>Whether the building/structure is ALREADY SAFE & its calculated values are below the tolerable levels — hence no protection is required.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">4. Design Your Lightning Protection</h3>
          <p>
            After you determine the level of protection, the next step is to design your LPS based on the level of safety. There are four levels of protection — Level I provides the highest level of protection, and Level IV provides the lowest level of protection.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">5. Choose the Appropriate Lightning Protection Method</h3>
          <p>After the level of protection is determined, choose the appropriate lightning protection method. There are 3 different methods:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2 mt-2">
            <li>Mesh Method</li>
            <li>Protection Angle Method</li>
            <li>Rolling Sphere Method</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">For an optimum and smart solution, you can combine the above mentioned methods. Rolling sphere method is stringent & needs to be followed in Industries & all critical installations.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">6. Refer to the Standard IS/IEC 62305 for:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li>Mesh Size</li>
            <li>Rolling sphere radius</li>
            <li>Protection angle</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">All the above parameters are based on your level of protection. If at all you choose the wrong level of protection, all your next steps would go wrong and your building/structure may not be safe during the event of lightning.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">7. Arrive at Bill of Materials</h3>
          <p>
            You arrive at the bill of materials and estimate the cost for your Lightning Protection System (LPS). FINALLY, your building/structure has an LPS complying with Indian/International standards & norms, and hereafter you can have the lightning protection system installed.

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-8 text-white/80 font-light leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          The harmonic frequency in a power system is the positive integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. Power factor (PF) refers to the ratio of working power in watts (KW) to perceived power in kilovolt amperes (KVA).
        </p>

        <p>
          Many Power utilities in India are billing their industrial and commercial consumers based on Active Energy Consumption (Kwh) along with fixed charges. In Maharashtra state, the consumers are charged based on kVAh consumption combining kWAh & kVArh. The prime objective of kVAh based billing is to encourage the consumers to maintain near unity power factor to achieve energy loss reduction, improve system stability, <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/pq-services.php" className="underline">PQ services</a>, and voltage profile.
        </p>

        <p>
          The average wattage losses in a typical industrial facility can be 15-20% of total demanded power. These wattage losses can be reduced by improving the power factor closer to unity and reducing the voltage and current harmonic distortion below 5%.
        </p>
        <img src="/BlogImg/blog-16.1.png" alt="Power Factor and Harmonic Studies" className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg"  loading="lazy" />

        <p>
          True/Total PF = Displacement PF × Distortion Factor. The distortion power factor is contributed by harmonics in the network and reduction in harmonic levels can improve the total power factor to reduce the overall Energy cost.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Hysteresis Losses</h3>
          <p>
            Hysteresis loss is caused by magnetization and demagnetization of the core as current flows in forward and reverse directions. The energy to accomplish the realignment of the magnetic domains comes from the input power and is not transferred to the secondary winding — it is therefore a loss and results in heat.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">Typical hysteresis losses as a percentage of Power Demand: <strong>1% – 2%</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Eddy-Current Losses</h3>
          <p>
            Eddy current losses are the result of Faraday's law. The induced EMF causes a circulating current called an Eddy current, proportional to the square of frequency. Eddy current losses occur in circuit breakers, lighting ballasts, transformers, motor starters, motor windings, and building wiring near steel/iron structures.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">Typical eddy current losses as a percentage of Power demand: <strong>2% to 3%</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Skin Effect Losses</h3>
          <p>
            When AC current is applied to a conductor, the current concentrates near the surface of the conductor. Harmonic loading increases skin effect losses by the square of the increase in frequency above nominal line frequency.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">Typical skin effect losses as a percentage of Power demand: <strong>2% to 4%</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Proximity Effect Losses</h3>
          <p>
            Proximity effect is caused by the mutual influence of multiple current carrying conductors. Their interaction causes uneven current distribution in the conductors, increasing the losses.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">Typical proximity effect losses as a percentage of Power demand: <strong>2% to 3%</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Transformer Losses</h3>
          <p>
            A non-linear load on a transformer leads to harmonic power losses causing increased operational costs and additional heating. It leads to higher losses, early fatigue of insulation, premature failure and reduction of the useful life of the transformer.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">Typical transformer losses as a percentage of Power Demand: <strong>2% to 5%</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Line Losses</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to I²R losses and dielectric losses, cables have other losses such as skin-effect and proximity-effect developed by magnetic induction. The harmonic currents can further increase the apparent AC resistance significantly above nominal DC resistance values.
          </p>

        <p>
          There are various types of Earthing, but two most popular types of Earthing/Grounding systems are <strong>"TYPE A"</strong> also known as TT Earthing and <strong>"TYPE B"</strong> also known as TN-C-S Earthing.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Type A Earthing (TT Earthing):</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li>Type A earthing is a conventional grounding approach.</li>
            <li>In this system, each electrical equipment is directly connected to an earth electrode, often using ground rods or plates buried in the ground.</li>
            <li>It is suitable for locations with low fault currents and provides safety and functional grounding, commonly used in residential and commercial settings.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Type B Earthing (TN-C-S Earthing):</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li>Type B earthing is a more advanced grounding method.</li>
            <li>It combines Type A principles with additional measures to protect against voltage surges and transient overvoltages.</li>
            <li>In this system, the earth terminal is connected to both the supply neutral and the ground electrode.</li>
            <li>It is used in areas with high fault currents, such as critical infrastructure and industrial facilities, to provide enhanced protection against surges and transients.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Concrete Embedded Foundation Earth Electrode (Type "B") vs. Soil Embedded Earth Electrode (Type "A"):</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to their reliable conductivity, concrete foundations are ideal for grounding because of their substantial contact area with the soil. For long-term performance, bare metal electrodes buried at least 5 cm into the concrete are recommended since they are corrosion resistant.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Advantages of Concrete-Embedded Foundation Earth Electrodes:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li><strong>Minimal Excavation:</strong> They eliminate the need for additional excavation, making them cost-effective.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather Resilience:</strong> Constructed at a suitable depth, they remain unaffected by seasonal weather conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Effective Soil Contact:</strong> They provide efficient grounding by maintaining excellent contact with the soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Extensive Coverage:</strong> Covering most of the foundation's surface, they minimize earth electrode impedance for optimal performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Lightning Protection:</strong> They serve as a robust earthing arrangement for lightning protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction Site Savings:</strong> During construction, they can also serve as an earth electrode for the site's electrical installation.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Protective Bonding:</strong> They can serve as a foundation for the main protective bonding system, aligning with standards.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          To adhere to the "Global Earthing Concept" described in IS 3043 - Code of Practice for Earthing, it is crucial to connect concrete-embedded foundation earth electrodes from different parts of a single foundation using suitable earthing conductors. For corrosion resistance, use only stainless-steel electrodes directly installed from the foundation concrete into the soil, avoiding hot-dip galvanized steel.

          Often customers are confused by different vendors, forcing them to believe that their product is the best in the world. When it comes to "Concept selling product" like SPDs, customer depends more on the vendors as there are many new technologies & standards. Some vendors try to influence the customer with their product without giving any proof or supporting document from Standards!!!

          Low voltage is defined as any AC RMS voltage up to 1000 V or DC peak voltage up to 1500 V. In general, <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/surge-protection-device.php" className="underline">SPDs</a> need to be installed at main DB, sub DB and at equipment level.

In the above figure instead of Class I and Class II, Class I + II can be used if Iimp value is taken care
It is because SPDs provide an “effective” protection distance of a maximum of 10 meters. It means, if the distance between the SPD and the equipment to be protected is greater than 10 meters, additional SPDs will be required. The crucial point to note in this case is that the “actual” wire length needs to be calculated rather than the physical distance between the SPD and equipment.

<p>
  Figure 2- Difference between physical distance and actual distance.<br/>
Physical location of equipment is important to select the quantity of SPDs. In the below Figure 3- 2 examples are given. In Example1, the number of PCs are 5 & in Example 2, the number of PCs are 4.. But in Example 1, one SPD is enough to protect all the 5 PCs as the “actual ‘ distance from SPD to the farthest PC- PC 3 is only 5 meters, because all the PCs are kept in one room, next to each other. Whereas. In Example 2, 4 number of SPDs are needed to protect 4 PCs , because 1 PC is located in each floor and the ‘actual” distance exceeds 10 m in Floors 1, 2 & 3.Only PC 1 does not require any additional SPD because the “actual’ distance from the SPD which is in Sub DB is only 5 meters away from PC1.

          NBC & IS recommend SPD for protection of sensitive electronic equipment from conducted surges through power & data cables. A variety of devices provides over-current protection, but <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/surge-protection-device.php" className="underline">Surge protection devices</a> are the only ones that can safeguard sensitive electronic equipment from overvoltage caused by contaminated power sources and the increasing use of non-linear devices.
        </p>

        <p>Transient over voltages are generated predominantly due to the following reasons:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
          <li>Whenever lightning strikes the power or signal cables directly or near the cables.</li>
          <li>As a consequence of faults in the power system.</li>
          <li>Switching on and off of heavy inductive loads etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>SPD terminology used by different standards bodies:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
          <li><strong>Class I, I+II, II, III</strong> — terminology used by IEC.</li>
          <li><strong>Type I, I+II, II, III</strong> — terminology used by European Norms (EN).</li>
          <li><strong>Class B, B+C, C, D</strong> — terminology used by Germans (VDE).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It is wise to use 12.5 kA Iimp rated, Class I+II MOV SPD as per IEC 60364-5-53 for L-N to avoid "follow current" problems associated with Spark gap devices for L-N in 3+1 configuration. It is important to use Spark gap SPD with 50 kA Iimp rating for N-PE because MOV will trip RCDs after getting aged.
        </p>

        <p>
          SPDs are simple, passive, non-linear components which cannot differentiate between lightning and switching surges. Whether it is spark gap, GDT, MOV or SAD (Silicon Avalanche Diode), they act when the voltage across them exceeds a pre-determined level.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
          <li><strong>Class I+II SPDs</strong> are recommended at the Main DB of all industries.</li>
          <li><strong>Class II SPDs</strong> are recommended at the Sub DB of all industries.</li>
          <li><strong>Class III SPDs</strong> are installed near sensitive/critical equipment.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/surge-protection-device" className="underline">Power line SPDs</a> (which are commonly connected parallel to the load) include a local indication (mechanical flag) as a standard feature and a remote signal (potential free contact) as an optional feature. JEF has a wide range of SPDs to suit all the above requirements.

        <p>
          CNC stands for computer numerical control, which is the automated control of machining instruments like drills, lathes, mills, and 3D printers using a computer. Failures in CNC machines happen due to two important disturbances in low voltage networks — steady state errors and transient errors.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">The Two Important Reasons for Failures Due to Lightning:</h3>
          <p>
            Direct hit (damage is visible), but direct lightning hit to a CNC machine is very rare as they are installed inside structures and fed by sub distribution boards. The other reason, often un-noticed, is distant lightning. In this case, the lightning current is carried by all types of cables except optic fiber cables.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          The more common problem encountered in normal plant life is corruption of EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read only memory), visible from sudden junk data appearing in the MMI (Man Machine Interface) panel. During a surge, a sudden high voltage appears in the EPROM pins — the IC believes it is in programming mode and data gets corrupted.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Common Myths:</h3>
          <p>Generally we feel that SPDs are not required as we have other existing protection arrangements viz. external lightning arrestor, MCB/MCCB, good earthing, bonding, shielding, isolation transformers, UPS, Intrinsically safe barriers, isolators etc. Unfortunately, the purposes of all these equipment are for different reasons and not for protecting equipment from transient surges:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2 mt-2">
            <li><strong>External Lightning protection</strong> with good earthing is for protecting the building from direct lightning strike.</li>
            <li><strong>MCB/MCCB</strong> is for protecting equipment from short circuit due to power frequency fault currents — they operate in milliseconds, by which time surges have already passed.</li>
            <li><strong>Earthing</strong> is for both personnel safety and equipment safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonding</strong> is to reduce the earth resistance and maintain equipotential.</li>
            <li><strong>Shielding</strong> is done to protect equipment from RFI/EMI effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation Transformer</strong> protects equipment from faults at the primary side.</li>
            <li><strong>UPS</strong> provides continuous power through battery in case of mains power failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Intrinsically Safe barriers or Isolators</strong> are used in hazardous plant areas to restrict electrical energy to very low levels.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Hence <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/surge-protection-device" className="underline">SPDs – Surge Protection Devices</a> are the only protectors for the CNC machines against transient surges. SPDs shall be installed with potential free contact, thermal disconnector, including base element & pluggable arresters to be connected between Phase to Neutral and between neutral to protective earth. Requirement class is Class I + II as per IEC 61643-11.

          We recently explored the causes of surges in Industrial & Commercial Power Systems. In this blog, we will discuss ways to protect electronic equipment from surges in industrial and commercial areas.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Why It's Imperative to Avoid Surges:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li><strong>Equipment Reliability:</strong> Unplanned downtime, costly repairs, and even equipment replacement can result from surges that compromise the reliability of equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Operational Continuity:</strong> Surges can disrupt operations, leading to financial losses and reduced productivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Surges have the ability to corrupt or destroy sensitive/vital data stored on servers and computer systems, resulting in permanent data loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Considerations:</strong> Electrical surges can be dangerous, causing device faults, overheating, or electrical fires.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">Types of Surges:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li><strong>Radiated Surges:</strong> Caused by lightning, can move across the air — Faraday Cages and shielding devices are frequently used to protect against them.</li>
            <li><strong>Conducted Surges:</strong> These go across power, data, and communication cables — SPDs are essential for mitigating the effects of conducted surges.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-2 uppercase">The Role of Surge Protection Devices (SPDs):</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li><strong>SPD Functionality:</strong> SPDs are normally inactive but activate during surges, similar to fuses but dependent on voltage rather than current.</li>
            <li><strong>Surge Handling:</strong> SPDs can tolerate several surges over time, with performance dependent on the amplitude of the shocks absorbed.</li>
            <li><strong>MCOV:</strong> SPDs become active when the voltage across them surpasses a predetermined level known as Maximum Continuous Operating Voltage.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
          Choosing the right SPD for a specific application is crucial, as is ensuring proper installation. Most Electrical Engineers are well-versed in installing current-operated devices like fuses and MCBs, but SPDs function differently as voltage-operated devices — a short, direct wire run is more critical than wire thickness.

          The AC power supply is a common <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/surge-protection-device" className="underline">source of surges</a>; unfortunately, the human eye cannot detect it. It is especially harmful in India, where overhead lines provide the majority of our power. As per IS/IEC 62305, Source S3 is Flash to the service line which has got all the loss, risk, and damages as in the case of flashes to the structure (Source S1). Any cable entering electronic equipment is also an easy path for the lightning current to enter and cause unexpected & untold damage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Surge or lightning protection devices safeguard electrical equipment from damage caused by over-voltage transient occurrences by blocking or diverting surge current to the ground rather than flowing through it.

          When it comes to electrical safety, earthing is always the first line of defense. The <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/grounding-system-solutions" className="underline">Earthing system</a> must be constructed in such a way that it is not required to be maintained.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though the methodology of Earthing has been well defined for MV and HV systems, there are a lot of misconceptions and myths about the practices adopted in the LV grounding systems. The design resistance value of the LV earth system is important because the relay settings and coordination are finalized based on the fault currents which depend on the earth resistance value.
        </p>

        <p>
          In India, the concept of maintenance free Earthing is gaining popularity while at the same time the Maintenance free concept is being more misunderstood.

            <li>
              <strong>MYTH:</strong> Use of Copper Electrode helps to obtain a low resistance.<br />
              <strong>FACT:</strong> The type of Metal used has no significance on the earth electrode resistance. None of the formulae given in any of the international standards factors in the type of metal in a calculation of the earth resistance. However, in highly corrosive areas, Cu or Cu coated electrodes are recommended due to better corrosion resistance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>MYTH:</strong> Low resistance can be obtained by using a special electrode.<br />
              <strong>FACT:</strong> As per IEEE80, IS3043 and BS7430, the resistance can be lowered only by altering the medium adjacent to the electrode — which is the backfill material — and not the electrode itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>MYTH:</strong> Resistance to Earth Electrode with or without highly conductive backfill will remain the same.<br />
              <strong>FACT:</strong> In fact, there is an improvement of over 31% in value of resistance by using carbon-based backfill.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>MYTH:</strong> The instrumental/electronic earth in a facility shall be maintained separately than electrical earth.<br />
              <strong>FACT:</strong> As per IEEE 142 & IEC 61000, if the electronic and electrical equipment earthing are maintained separately, dangerous overvoltage may be induced in the system during lightning/severe fault conditions, causing catastrophic failure of electronic equipment.

          An isolated/Independent earth electrode is nothing but an electrically independent earth electrode; it is distinct by definition from the myth or we typically see.
        </p>
        <p>
          For safety and functionality, an earthing &amp; grounding system connects certain elements of an electric power system to the ground, generally the Earth's conductive surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          An electrically independent <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/grounding-system-solutions" className="underline">earth electrode</a> is defined as one that is positioned "at such a distance from the nearest electrode that the greatest current likely to pass through one of them does not appreciably affect the potential of other electrodes." The distance mentioned is nothing but a distance more than the "sphere of influence".

          Generally, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineers feel that <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/role-of-grounding-in-electrical-safety" className="underline">electrical earthing</a> is "dirty earthing" and their equipment will fail if all earthing systems are interconnected. They wish to keep a separate earthing system for their application. Though Electronic equipment can have independent earth electrodes, they should be connected to other earthing systems below the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per the concept of "Global earthing", electrical earthing, electronic earthing, instrumentation earthing, communication earthing, structure earthing and <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/lightning-protection-products" className="underline">lightning protection system</a> earthing, should be interconnected below the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Concept of isolated earth electrode is not relevant for electronic and instrumentation systems since there are always links with other earth electrodes through (a) soil and (b) through parasitic elements such as capacitance and mutual inductance. Also during lightning or power system fault, high transient over voltage develops between this "isolated" earthing system and other parts of the installation — which is dangerous for equipment safety, personal safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).
        </p>
        <p>
          The same is applicable for very low level voltage signals such as thermocouples whose voltage range is in milli volts. The earthing of these equipment also needs to be connected with other earthing systems below the ground. This is a recommended practice as per IEC 62305-4 — Protection against lightning, Protection of Electrical &amp; Electronic equipment inside the structure. In case of earth loop problems, an "earth coupler" can be used to isolate the earthing under normal conditions and connect during lightning conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in its 2016 draft version also confirms connecting all earthing systems under Regulation 37 and Regulation 41. All metal works — enclosures/body of all electrical, electronics, instrumentation, and communication equipment — shall be connected with an earthing system as per IS 3043, IS/IEC 62305 &amp; IS/IEC 61643-11.

        </p>
        <p>
          A windmill is a device that uses sails set on a spinning shaft to harness the energy of the wind. India's economy is growing rapidly and the utilization of regenerative energy is on a steady rise. Windmills, Solar PV &amp; bio-gas plants are becoming popular day by day.
        </p>
        <p>
          IEC 61400-24: Lightning Protection of Wind Turbines is the basis for the solution. There are two common challenges for windmills: they are much taller than the surrounding environment (100 m &amp; above), and the concentration of electrical &amp; electronic systems is confined in a small area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The electrical &amp; electronic system includes switchgear cabinets, motors, drives, frequency converters, actuators, sensors, control electronics including communication bus systems employing Modbus or Profibus protocol via RS 485 physical layer.

          Soil resistivity is a measurement of the resistance or electric current that the soil conducts. The design of a system based on passing current across the surface of the earth is a key component.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soil resistivity plays a vital role in the design of an earthing system. For substations, the key design acceptance (safety) criteria of touch and step potentials are greatly influenced by soil resistivity. For other <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/grounding-system-solutions" className="underline">grounding systems</a> such as industrial plants, commercial, and residential buildings, the acceptance criteria of overall grounding resistance and current density on the electrode surface are also dependent on soil resistivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soil resistivity can be measured in a variety of methods. Electrical profiling is the best approach for assessing <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/soil-treatment-for-good-earthing" className="underline">soil resistivity for the design of earthing and safety requirements</a>. Wenner's Four-Point Method is the most popular and user-friendly method. In this method, four spikes with equal spacing are connected to the soil resistivity meter. The current is injected through the extreme spikes and the potential drop is measured between the inner (potential) spikes.
        </p>

          The resistivity of the soil is dependent on salt content, moisture, and temperature. The resistivity of the soil cannot stay uniform throughout the life of the system as the soil can be eroded due to wind, rain, floods, and manmade actions.

          If variation in readings exceeds 30% in a given direction, the soil is deemed non-uniform and a multilayer soil model shall be used for designing. While using a simple average of measured soil resistivity values for design, the margin of error in safety parameters can easily exceed 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standards have provided formulas to determine approximate values of touch and step potentials for uniform layer and two-layer soils. For multi-layer soil, it is necessary to use software simulation models as prescribed in IEEE 80 Annex H. The CDEGS software by SES has multi-layer modelling capability and provides accurate and optimum design.

          Lightning is a natural phenomenon involving a very high quantum of destructive energy. Lightning is unavoidable. <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/lightning-protection-products" className="underline">Lightning protection</a> and reliable protection is the only solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lightning is an electrostatic discharge that is naturally occurring and briefly normalizes two electrically charged areas in or on the ground, generating an instantaneously large amount of energy. A flash is caused by a thunderstorm conflicting loads in the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lightning is generated by circulating winds and water molecules in a thunderstorm cloud. The circulating winds are essentially low intensity air currents that can dislodge the electrons from the water molecules in the cloud. As a result of the removal of electrons, two charged masses of opposite polarity are created within the cloud. These two charged masses of opposite polarity strive to attain equilibrium, resulting in a lightning discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
          One form of lightning is where a discharge takes place from the negatively charged portion to the positively charged portion within the cloud. This is commonly known as intra-cloud lightning.
        </p>
        <img src="/BlogImg/blog-29.1.png" alt="Intra Cloud Lightning" className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg"  loading="lazy" />
        <p>
          Occasionally, the charged mass from the base of a cloud moves towards earth in steps. This stream of charge is known as a natural down streamer and it induces a charge of opposite polarity at any sharp points on the earth's surface. The sharp points on the earth send out their own upward streamers. Since the two streamers are opposite in polarity, they are attracted towards each other. When they meet, the air gap between the cloud and the earth breaks down, resulting in the cloud being wired to the earth. All the energy in the cloud flows down this corridor to the earth — this is termed as lightning. This energy can be of the order of a few hundred mega joules and it hits the earth in a few microseconds.
        </p>
        <img src="/BlogImg/blog-29.2.png" alt="Cloud to Ground Lightning" className="w-full h-auto rounded-lg"  loading="lazy" />
        <p>
          It is important to note that for any given downstream from the cloud, there can be many up streamers going from the earth's surface. Whichever up streamer manages to establish contact with the downstream first will route the lightning strike to the point where the up streamer has originated. This entire phenomenon occurs in a few milliseconds and is invisible to the human eye. Given the above, it is almost impossible to predict when and where lightning will strike. Hence, we must be adequately prepared at all times to protect ourselves against these dangerous natural phenomena.

        <p>
          The visible components of the electrical system, such as Earth Electrodes, are successfully addressed by general maintenance practices. The Grounding System suffers from the "OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND" issue because the majority of it is buried beneath and unreachable.
        </p>
        <p>
          A complete <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/grounding-system-solutions" className="underline">grounding system</a>, including the Equipment Earth Conductor, Earth Electrode, and Earth Grid/Mat, should provide a low resistance path for fault current to flow, allowing breakers to trip in time to avoid incidents such as fire, short circuit, and electric shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          One common misconception is that if the measured overall earth resistance value is 1 Ω or less, the grounding system is safe. However, resistance of 1 Ω is NOT AT ALL indicative of the grounding system's safety or health.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Low Earth Pit Resistance ≠ Safety. Whereas Low Earth Loop Impedance = Breaker Tripping on time = Safety.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The grounding system's principal purpose is to allow enough current to flow through the earth fault loop so that the protective device can detect a possible fault and isolate the damaged circuit in a reasonable amount of time. The magnitude of current that will flow through the earth loop in case of a fault depends on the impedance of the earth fault loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/earthing-misconceptions" className="underline">Another myth revolves around the concept of Global Grounding.</a> As per the concept of "Global earthing", electrical earthing, electronic earthing, instrumentation earthing, communication earthing, structure earthing and lightning protection system earthing should be interconnected below the ground. This is recommended in IS 3043, IS/IEC 62305, IEC 61000-5-2, and IEEE 142 Standards.

          <p>
            An important aspect in today's complicated electrical systems is to have a robust and optimal design solution. The best techno-economic solution in the design of grounding systems is only possible through Multi Layer Soil Modeling and computer-aided designs involving high-end technical software such as CDEGS.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Grounding Compound</h3>
          <p>
            According to IEEE 142, the Backfill compound affects the crucial region around the electrodes. The grounding system's long-term reliability is determined by the type and quality of the backfill compound. IEEE/BS standards recommend using ground enhancement material or conductive concrete with a resistance of less than 0.12 Ohm meter surrounding the electrodes for enhanced long-term stability. The carbon-based ground improvement compounds are long-lasting and don't leach chemicals into the soil.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Indian &amp; International standards recognize that treating an area of about 75 to 100 mm surrounding the Electrode with ground enhancement materials will significantly reduce the earth resistance, generally in the region of 25 to 40%. The IEC 62561-7 for backfill compound recommends a series of tests to ensure the compounds do not contain any harmful chemicals. It is also important to test these compounds for conformity to ANSI/NSF 60 standards since 40% of the water requirement in India is met from ground water.

          The resistance of an earth electrode purely depends on the <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/importance-of-soil-resistance" className="underline">soil resistivity</a> and type of electrode used. Conventionally, a cast iron plate/GI pipe is used as an electrode filled with soil mixed with salt and charcoal. The conduction of current in the conventional electrode is electrolytic. Hence, regular watering and charging of the earth pit with salt is very essential to maintain low earth resistance.

        <p>
          <strong>Power Line</strong> — Most power line protectors used in AC power low voltage applications, especially those used in Main DB &amp; Sub DB, are connected parallel to the load, so they can be used without worrying about the load current. Low voltage means any AC RMS voltage from 1V to 1000 V and DC up to 1500 V.

          <strong>Data Line</strong> — All data line protectors are connected in series to the load, though the basic protection components (GDT, MOV, SAD) are always connected in parallel.

          Some earth pits are installed at various locations throughout an electrical system for different applications such as transformer neutral, equipment body, lightning arrestors, and electronic equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The practice adopted earlier was to keep all these earth pits electrically separated. We examined several reputable national and international standards, including IS3043, BS7430, IEC 61000-5-2, IEC 62305-3, and IEEE 142-2007. All the above standards have clearly advocated the need to interconnect all earth systems to achieve equipotential.

            Transformer neutral should be solidly interconnected to the general earth grid as per IS3043, Clause 22.1.3 and 22.3.1. The standard has permitted and advocated the interlinking of the neutral earth pit with the general body earth, and mentions that the earlier practice of separate/isolated earth for transformer neutral needs to be revised to AVOID UNNECESSARY REDUNDANCY AND EXPENDITURE.

          <p>
            IEC 62305-3 and BS7430 have clearly recommended that the <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/need-for-lps" className="underline">lightning protection system</a> earth should solidly bond to the general earth grid to avoid dangerous potential differences between two unconnected earth systems in case of a lightning current.

          <p>
            IEEE 142-2007 (Clause 5.5.3, Page 193) specifically states that a possible lack of understanding led to erroneous installation requirements using isolated earthings for electronic equipment. Analysis of various catastrophic incidents indicated that separation of grounds was responsible for very large voltages being impressed on electronic equipment components under thunderstorm conditions.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            IEC 61000-5-2 (Clause 5.3.1) does not encourage the use of independent "ISOLATED" <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/type-a-vs-type-b-earthing" className="underline">earth electrodes</a> for computer and electrical systems. IEEE 1100-2003 (Clause 4.8.5.1) clearly mentions that electronic equipment should not use isolated grounds and details the benefits of connecting dedicated electronic earthing to the general earth grid.

        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>Conclusion:</strong> All earth systems in a given electrical installation — neutral earth, lightning protection system earth, and electronic earth — should have their own dedicated earth pit/earth terminations. However, they should never be isolated from the general earth grid. These dedicated earth pits should be connected to the general earth grid to achieve equipotential, thereby avoiding catastrophic failures.

          Soil treatment for good earthing is a positive technique of improving the resistance of earth electrodes, especially when the hard underlying rock is incapable of accommodating deeper soil rows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resistance of the electrode mainly comprises of resistance of the electrode itself and the soil resistivity. However, soil resistivity wields the major influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technology to achieve good earthing mainly depends on the <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/grounding-system-solutions" className="underline">Backfill Compound</a>, as it influences the critical area around the electrode as mentioned in IEEE 142. For greater degree of performance, IEEE/BS Standards recommend ground enhancement material or conductive concrete with very low resistivity to be used around the electrode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Treating an area of around 75 to 100 mm surrounding the electrode with Ground Enhancement Materials with very low resistivity reduces the earth resistance significantly, usually by 25 to 50 percent, according to Indian and international standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The carbon-based special backfill compounds used in JEF's solution do not rely on moisture for conduction and are very stable over a long period. Hence JEF ECO-SAFE Grounding System is truly MAINTENANCE FREE.

          CNC stands for computer numerical control — the automated control of machining instruments like drills, lathes, mills, and 3D printers using a computer. The primary function of CNC machines — precise and automatic motion control — makes this sophisticated machine so popular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failures in CNC machines happen due to two important disturbances in low voltage networks: steady state errors (over voltage lasting several cycles, harmonics, RFI/EMI effects) and transient errors (transient over voltages due to lightning surges and switching surges from welding, capacitor bank switching, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          The more common problem encountered in normal plant life is corruption of EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory), visible from sudden junk data appearing in the MMI (Man Machine Interface) panel. During a surge, a sudden high voltage appears in the pins of the IC, causing it to believe it is in programming mode — this is the cause of EPROM corruption.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Common Myths About Existing Protection</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-3">
            <li><strong>External Lightning Protection</strong> — for protecting the building from direct lightning strike only, not equipment surges</li>
            <li><strong>MCB/MCCB</strong> — for protecting against short circuit due to power frequency fault currents; they operate in milliseconds, by which time surges have already passed through</li>
            <li><strong>Earthing</strong> — for personnel safety and equipment safety, not transient surge protection</li>
            <li><strong>Shielding</strong> — to protect equipment from RFI/EMI effects only</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation Transformer</strong> — mainly to protect equipment from faults on the primary side</li>
            <li><strong>UPS</strong> — to provide continuous power through battery in case of mains power failure</li>
            <li><strong>Intrinsically Safe Barriers</strong> — to restrict electrical energy in hazardous areas</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Hence <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/surge-protection-device" className="underline">SPDs — Surge Protection Devices</a> — are the only protectors for CNC machines against transient surges. Depending on the incoming supply (3-phase with or without neutral), SPDs with potential-free contact and thermal disconnector shall be installed between Phase to Neutral and Neutral to Protective Earth. Requirement class is Class I+II as per IEC 61643-11.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first level of defence. For MMI having 24V DC power supply or PLC with DI/DO, suitable additional SPDs need to be selected. Please contact us for a holistic solution which will ensure decades of trouble-free operation of all your sensitive electronic equipment.

          Soil resistivity is a measurement of the resistance or electric current that the soil conducts. The design of a system based on passing current across the surface of the earth is a key component.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soil resistivity plays a vital role in the design of an earthing system. For substations, the key design acceptance (safety) criteria of touch and step potentials are greatly influenced by soil resistivity. For other <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/grounding-system-solutions" className="underline">grounding systems</a> such as industrial plants, commercial and residential buildings, the acceptance criteria of overall grounding resistance and current density on the electrode surface are also dependent on soil resistivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soil resistivity can be measured in a variety of methods. Electrical profiling is the best approach for assessing <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/soil-treatment-for-good-earthing" className="underline">soil resistivity for the design of earthing and safety requirements</a>. Wenner's Four-Point Method is the most popular and user-friendly method. In this method, four spikes with equal spacing are connected to the soil resistivity meter. The current is injected through the extreme (current) spikes and the potential drop is measured between the inner (potential) spikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resistivity of the soil is dependent on salt content, moisture, and temperature. The resistivity cannot stay uniform throughout the life of the system as the soil can be eroded due to wind, rain, floods, and manmade actions.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Parameters Impacting Soil Resistivity Measurement</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-3">
            <li>Presence of loose/backfilled soil</li>
            <li>Presence of buried metals like water, gas, other process pipelines and cables</li>
            <li>Presence of live HT lines above the test setup which may induce current in the cables connecting the spikes</li>
            <li>Presence of water table near the measurement area or any earth grid of a substation</li>
            <li>Distance of any such earth grids and water table from the soil resistivity measurement area should be at least the spacing between the spikes</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          If the largest variation in a given direction exceeds 30%, the soil is deemed non-uniform and a multilayer soil model shall be used for designing. While using a simple average (arithmetic mean) of measured soil resistivity values for design, the margin of error in safety parameters due to soil resistivity can easily exceed 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standards have provided formulas to determine approximate values of touch and step potentials for uniform layer and two-layer soils. For multi-layer soil, it is necessary to use software simulation models as prescribed in IEEE 80 Annex H. The CDEGS software by SES has multi-layer modelling capability and provides accurate and optimum design with least possible error.

          The Power line SPD and Data line SPDs have distinct selection principles compared to fuse/MCBs, as well as different selection criteria. Data line SPDs include all SPDs other than power line applications — viz. Communication, Instrumentation, Voice, data, Ethernet, RS 485, RS 422, etc.

          <strong>Application Note: Lightning protection &amp; Surge protection requirement for Wind Turbines as per IEC 61400-24.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A windmill is a device that uses sails set on a spinning shaft to harness the energy of the wind. India's economy is growing rapidly and the utilization of regenerative energy is on a steady rise. IEC 61400-24: Lightning Protection of Wind Turbines is the basis for the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two common challenges for windmills: they are much taller than the surrounding environment (100 m &amp; above), and the concentration of electrical &amp; electronic systems is confined in a small area.

          Thunder storms occur almost everywhere in the world. A lightning strike has the potential to damage just about any type of structure. Although nothing can prevent lightning from striking, a lightning protection system will intercept the strike and disperse it safely into the ground — saving households and businesses from a great deal of upset and inconvenience.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Dangers of Lightning</h3>
          <p>
            Lightning is a natural phenomenon that can produce voltages greater than 100 million volts, while reaching temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun. A lightning strike can create power surges, causing electricity to sweep through a property's wiring or plumbing system. With a real risk of fire, the attic will commonly catch light when a lightning bolt comes through the roof. The Empire State Building is struck by lightning approximately 100 times each year.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Lightning Rods</h3>
          <p>
            In a lightning protection system, strike termination rods in the shape of lightning rods are positioned in the most exposed extremities and on the highest parts of a structure at regular intervals — they become the most likely point of contact for the lightning, creating the quickest path to the ground. Although it doesn't prevent a lightning strike, a lightning protection system provides an effective grounding network that creates a low-resistance path to the ground.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Grounding Electricity</h3>
          <p>
            Copper and Aluminium materials create a low-resistance path to the ground for the lightning's potentially dangerous electricity. When a lightning protection system is in place it intercepts the strike, directing it safely to the ground without impacting a building's structure or contents.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Surge Protection</h3>
          <p>
            Post lightning strike, impulse current is dissipated through a low impedance path (down conductors to the earth termination system). Part of lightning/impulse current gets coupled into the building through utility services like power lines, data lines, and metallic pipelines. Since lightning overvoltages are typically limited to few microseconds, normal devices (fuses, MCBs) are unable to protect against these — hence new class of protective devices (SPD) which respond in a few microseconds are needed. The complete system will include conductors, strike termination rods, ground terminals and inter-connecting bonding to minimize side-flashing and surge protection devices for power, data and communication lines.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Installation</h3>
          <p>
            The SPDs are installed on the electrical service panels and on any other incoming lines — they serve as the first defence against harmful electrical surges. Lightning rods are installed at the highest point, such as on the roof. All buildings must have a minimum of two ground rods set as wide apart as possible, normally in diagonally opposite corners. Once a lightning protection system is installed, regular maintenance and periodic safety checks are required. JEF Techno offers a wide range of technical services for maintaining your lightning protection system &amp; SPDs.

        <p>
          The analysis of electromagnetic interference between high voltage overhead power transmission lines and nearby gas or oil pipelines has been a topic of growing interest for many years. When pipelines are located in a shared row with power lines, the pipeline can suffer high induced voltages and currents due to AC interference. The induced voltage can be dangerous for an operator to touch the pipeline, and pipe corrosion can result from AC discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AC interference is due to three main phenomena: Inductive, Conductive, and Capacitive coupling.
        </p>
        <div>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Inductive Coupling:</strong> Voltages are induced in nearby metallic conductors by magnetic coupling with high voltage lines, resulting in currents flowing in a conducting pipeline and existence of voltages between it and the surrounding soil.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conductive Coupling:</strong> When a ground fault occurs in HV Power Lines, the current flowing through the grounding grid produces a potential rise on both the grounding grid and the neighboring soil. If the pipeline goes through the "zone of influence" of this potential rise, a high difference in electrical potential can appear across the coating of the pipeline.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Capacitive Coupling:</strong> Affects only aerial pipelines situated in the proximity of HV Power Lines. For underground pipelines, the effect of capacitive coupling may not be considered because of the screening effect of earth against electric fields.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>w
        <p>
          Pipelines can suffer the potential loss of metal and resultant risk of leakage of product due to AC corrosion. It is very important to understand the interaction between the transmission lines (power system), pipeline and the cathodic protection systems to assess the impact of AC Interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          A comprehensive study of the system through field data collection and software modeling can provide solutions that can help limit AC corrosion and achieve safety. The study will take into account various factors including soil structure, transmission line parameters, pipeline data and existing cathodic protection measures to assess problem areas and design cost-effective mitigation solutions.

          Power Quality is used synonymously with supply reliability, service quality, voltage quality, and quality of supply. IEEE defines it as "the concept of powering and grounding sensitive equipment in a manner that is suitable to the operation of that equipment." IEC 61000-4-30 defines it as "Characteristics of the electricity at a given point on an electrical system, evaluated against a set of reference technical parameters."
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, power quality is related to disturbances in voltage, current, frequency, and power factor. Poor power quality means there is ample deviation from norms in the power supply that may cause equipment malfunction or failure.

        <p>
          Thunder storms occur almost everywhere in the world. A lightning strike has the potential to damage just about any type of structure. Although nothing can prevent lightning from striking, a lightning protection system will intercept the strike and disperse it safely into the ground — saving households and businesses from a great deal of upset and inconvenience.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Dangers of Lightning</h3>
          <p>
            Lightning is a natural phenomenon that can produce voltages greater than 100 million volts, while reaching temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun. A lightning strike can create power surges, causing electricity to sweep through a property's wiring or plumbing system. With a real risk of fire, the attic will commonly catch light when a lightning bolt comes through the roof.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Lightning Rods</h3>
          <p>
            In a lightning protection system, strike termination rods in the shape of lightning rods are positioned in the most exposed extremities and on the highest parts of a structure at regular intervals — they become the most likely point of contact for the lightning, creating the quickest path to the ground. A lightning protection system provides an effective grounding network that creates a low-resistance path to the ground.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Grounding Electricity</h3>
          <p>
            Copper and Aluminium materials create a low-resistance path to the ground for the lightning's potentially dangerous electricity. When a lightning protection system is in place it intercepts the strike, directing it safely to the ground without impacting a building's structure or contents. Today, lightning protection systems are built into the structural design of many homes, public buildings, and business premises.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Surge Protection</h3>
          <p>
            Post lightning strike, impulse current is dissipated through a low impedance path (down conductors to the earth termination system). Part of the lightning/impulse current gets coupled into the building through utility services like power lines, data lines, and metallic pipelines. Since lightning overvoltages are typically limited to few microseconds, normal protective devices (fuses, MCBs) are unable to protect against these. New class of protective devices (SPD) which respond in a few microseconds are needed. The complete system will include conductors, strike termination rods, ground terminals, inter-connecting bonding to minimize side-flashing, and surge protection devices to prevent harmful electrical surges in power, data, and communication lines.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Installation</h3>
          <p>
            The SPDs are installed on the electrical service panels and on any other incoming lines. Lightning rods are installed at the highest point, such as on the roof. All buildings must have a minimum of two ground rods set as wide apart as possible. Once a lightning protection system is installed, regular maintenance and periodic safety checks are required. JEF Techno offers a wide range of technical services for maintaining your lightning protection system &amp; SPDs.

        <p>
          The Power line SPD and Data line SPDs have distinct selection principles compared to fuse/MCBs, as well as different selection criteria. Data line SPDs include all SPDs other than power line applications — viz. Communication, Instrumentation, Voice, data, Ethernet, RS 485, RS 422, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Power Line</strong> — Most power line protectors used in AC power low voltage applications, especially those used in Main DB &amp; Sub DB, are connected parallel to the load. Low voltage means any AC RMS voltage from 1V to 1000 V and DC up to 1500 V.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Line</strong> — All data line protectors are connected in series to the load, though the basic protection components (GDT, MOV, SAD) are always connected in parallel. In data line SPDs, the series component — generally resistors or inductors — determines the load current that can pass through the SPDs.
        </p>
        <div>

        <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Not Every Electrical Risk in a Hospital Is Visible</h3>
        <p>
          A ventilator doesn't stop because someone forgot to switch it on. It stops because somewhere upstream — in a panel, an earth pit, or a backup generator that hasn't been tested in a year — something failed quietly, long before anyone noticed.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's the uncomfortable truth about electrical risk in healthcare facilities: the failures that matter most are almost never the ones you can see. A cracked switch or a burning smell gets attention immediately. A degraded earth connection, a marginally overloaded distribution board, or a lightning protection system with one corroded joint gives no warning at all — until the day it does.
        </p>
        <p>
          For hospitals, that "day it does" moment can mean a dialysis machine going dark mid-session, an ICU losing monitoring power, or an operating theatre depending on a backup generator that hasn't actually been load-tested in months. With India's regulatory framework for hospital electrical safety — CEA 2023, NABH accreditation criteria, the newly notified NBCS 2026 (National Building Construction Standards, replacing NBC 2016), and IS 17512:2021 for electrical installations in medical locations — tightening steadily, hospitals that treat electrical safety as a once-in-a-while checklist item are the ones most exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the five risks that show up most often when a proper electrical and fire safety audit is finally carried out — and why each one matters more in a hospital than almost anywhere else.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">1. Thermal Hotspots in Electrical Panels</h3>
          <p>
            Loose connections, aging breakers, and overworked joints generate heat long before they generate a visible spark. In most buildings, that heat dissipates and nobody's the wiser for years. In a hospital, that same panel might be feeding an OT, an ICU, or a diagnostic imaging suite that can't tolerate even a brief trip.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Thermal imaging during a routine audit — scanning panels, busbars, and cable terminations under normal load — catches these hotspots while they're still a maintenance item, not an outage. Left unchecked, they're one of the leading causes of electrical fires in commercial and healthcare buildings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">2. Overloaded Distribution Networks</h3>
          <p>
            Hospitals rarely stay the same size they were designed for. A new MRI suite, an extra dialysis bay, or a wing added over the years all draw load from infrastructure that may not have been resized to match. The result is distribution boards and feeders running consistently closer to their rated capacity than anyone realizes.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            An overloaded network doesn't fail dramatically — it fails as nuisance tripping, voltage sag, and premature equipment wear, all of which quietly erode the reliability of life-critical equipment like ventilators and anesthesia machines.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">3. Degraded Earthing Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Earthing is the part of hospital electrical infrastructure that's least visible and most consequential. Soil conditions change, connections corrode underground, and an earth pit that tested perfectly at commissioning can drift well outside safe resistance values years later — with zero outward sign.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            This matters more in hospitals than almost anywhere else because of the patient-contact equipment involved. IS 17512:2021, India's dedicated standard for electrical installations in medical locations, sets out strict earthing, bonding, and leakage-current requirements specifically because an earthing fault near a patient connected to electromedical equipment isn't just a compliance gap — it's a direct shock hazard. Periodic earth pit testing and soil resistivity checks are the only way to catch this before it becomes one.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">4. Ineffective Lightning Protection</h3>
          <p>
            A lightning protection system is judged almost entirely by whether it's still intact — down conductors that haven't corroded, air terminations still correctly bonded, test links still accessible and continuous. None of that is visible from the ground, and none of it announces itself until a strike finds the weak point.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            For hospitals — often taller structures, frequently housing sensitive diagnostic and life-support electronics — an <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/how-lps-work-2" className="underline">LPS adequacy audit</a> against IS/IEC 62305 isn't a formality. It's the difference between a lightning event being a non-event and it being a facility-wide power incident during a medical emergency.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">5. Emergency Power System Vulnerabilities</h3>
          <p>
            This is the risk hospitals worry about most and audit least. Backup generators and UPS systems are typically switched on for brief test runs, not put through a genuine load test that mirrors what they'd actually have to carry during a real outage. A DG set that starts fine on a no-load test can still fail to carry the hospital's full critical load when it matters.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            A proper audit verifies automatic transfer switching, actual load-bearing capacity, fuel and battery readiness, and — critically — how quickly life-critical circuits (OT, ICU, blood bank, dialysis) are restored after a supply interruption. Under CEA 2023's strengthened inspection and supervision requirements, and NABH's expectations around infrastructure reliability, this isn't optional documentation — it's operational insurance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Why This Matters Beyond Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            CEA 2023, NABH, NBCS 2026, and IS 17512 exist because these five risks are exactly the ones that turn into patient-safety incidents when they go unchecked. Compliance is the floor, not the goal — the real objective is a hospital where a dialysis session, an ICU shift, or a surgery in progress is never at the mercy of a panel nobody's thermal-scanned in three years.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            JEF has carried out more than 16,000 electrical and fire safety audits across 30+ years of practice, including for hospitals and other life-critical facilities, using a combination of engineering expertise and a proprietary automated audit tool to identify, prioritize, and document these exact risk categories before they become incidents.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            If your facility hasn't had a full electrical and fire safety audit recently — or if the last one didn't include thermal imaging and earth pit testing — it's worth finding out where you stand before an outage forces the question.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-3">
            <li>
              <strong>What are the most common electrical risks in hospitals?</strong> The five most common are thermal hotspots in electrical panels, overloaded distribution networks, degraded earthing systems, ineffective lightning protection, and vulnerabilities in emergency power systems (backup generators and UPS). Each one develops gradually and rarely shows visible warning signs before it causes equipment failure or an outage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Why is earthing so critical in hospital electrical systems specifically?</strong> Hospitals connect patients directly to electromedical equipment — dialysis machines, ECG monitors, infusion pumps — which makes earthing faults a direct shock risk, not just an equipment issue. IS 17512:2021 sets strict earthing, bonding, and leakage-current limits for medical locations for exactly this reason, with tighter touch-voltage limits in operating theatres and ICUs than in general areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How often should a hospital's backup power system be load-tested?</strong> Manufacturers and most facility standards recommend monthly test runs, but a genuine load test — one that verifies the generator can actually carry the hospital's full critical load, not just start and idle — should be part of an annual electrical and fire safety audit at minimum, with more frequent checks for facilities with older DG sets or recent load additions like new imaging equipment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Can thermal imaging really catch an electrical fault before it becomes a fire?</strong> Yes. Loose connections, degraded breakers, and overloaded joints heat up well before they spark or fail outright. A thermal scan performed under normal operating load will show these hotspots as a clear temperature differential, letting maintenance teams fix the connection or component while it's still a scheduled repair rather than an emergency.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>What standards govern electrical and fire safety audits for hospitals in India?</strong> The key frameworks are the CEA (Measures Relating to Safety and Electric Supply) Regulations 2023, NABH accreditation criteria for infrastructure and patient safety, IS 17512:2021 for electrical installations in medical locations, and NBCS 2026 (National Building Construction Standards, which replaced NBC 2016 in April 2026) for building-level fire and life-safety provisions. A hospital audit should be benchmarked against all four, not just one.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Does my hospital need an electrical audit if we haven't had any incidents?</strong> Yes — that's exactly the point of a proactive audit. Every risk in this article develops silently; the absence of an incident so far reflects how long a fault has been tolerable, not that infrastructure is sound. Facilities that wait for a visible problem before auditing are, by definition, finding out about these risks after they've already started causing damage.

        <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">A Report Is Just the Beginning: What a Hospital Electrical & Fire Safety Audit Actually Delivers</h3>
        <p>
          Ask most facility teams what an electrical safety audit produces, and the honest answer is usually: "a report we file somewhere." That's the wrong expectation to walk in with — and it's also the reason a lot of hospitals underinvest in audits until a genuine incident forces the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          A properly run <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/hidden-electrical-risks-hospitals-should-know" className="underline">electrical and fire safety audit for a hospital</a> isn't a document. It's a structured, standards-mapped diagnosis of exactly where infrastructure reliability, patient safety, and regulatory compliance stand today — followed by a corrective roadmap that tells you, in order of urgency, what to fix and why. In a facility where a power interruption can mean a ventilator, a dialysis session, or a surgery in progress, that roadmap is the actual deliverable. The PDF is just how it's handed to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is what should actually be inside it — and the standards each piece is meant to satisfy.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Detailed Asset Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            Every electrical asset relevant to patient safety and continuity of care — main and sub-distribution panels, transformers, UPS systems, DG sets, earthing pits, lightning protection components, and fire detection/suppression wiring — gets individually inspected and documented, not sampled. For a hospital, "we checked a representative sample" isn't good enough when the asset you skipped happens to feed the ICU.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Thermal Imaging Findings</h3>
          <p>
            Panels, busbars, and cable terminations are scanned under normal operating load to surface hotspots invisible to a visual inspection — the same failure mode covered in our companion piece on <a href="https://www.jeftechno.com/blog/hidden-electrical-risks-hospitals-should-know" className="underline">hidden electrical risks in hospitals</a>. The audit report should show the actual thermal images alongside the temperature differentials flagged, not just a pass/fail note.

          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Earthing and Lightning Protection Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            Earth pit resistance testing, soil resistivity measurement, and continuity checks across bonding and lightning protection down-conductors, benchmarked against IS 3043 (earthing) and IS/IEC 62305 (lightning protection) — with particular attention, for hospitals, to the tighter touch-voltage and leakage-current limits IS 17512:2021 sets for medical locations like operating theatres and ICUs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Risk Prioritisation Matrix</h3>
          <p>
            This is the deliverable that turns a list of findings into an action plan. Every issue identified gets ranked — typically by likelihood and consequence — so a hospital's facilities team and management aren't left guessing whether the loose panel connection in the basement or the aging DG transfer switch needs attention first. Without this matrix, an audit report is just a list; with it, it's a decision-making tool.

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Compliance Review</h3>
          <p>
            Findings get explicitly mapped against the regulatory frameworks a hospital is actually accountable to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-3 mt-4">
            <li>
              <strong>CEA 2023</strong> (Central Electricity Authority's Measures Relating to Safety and Electric Supply Regulations) — which specifically calls out hospitals among the building types requiring defined safety measures and periodic inspection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>NABH Accreditation Criteria</strong> — where infrastructure safety and patient-safety systems are direct assessment parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>IS 17512:2021</strong> — India's dedicated standard for electrical installations in medical locations, covering zoning (Group 0/1/2), isolated power systems for OTs and ICUs, and insulation monitoring.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>NBCS 2026</strong> — the National Building Construction Standards that replaced NBC 2016 in April 2026, covering building-level fire and life-safety provisions; hospitals should note this transition explicitly moved several fire-safety provisions from mandatory to advisory at the BIS level, which makes state/municipal adoption and a hospital's own internal standard even more important to confirm.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Corrective Action Recommendations</h3>
          <p>
            For every risk flagged, a specific, practical corrective step — not a generic "consult an electrician" note. This is where the audit shifts from diagnosis to remediation: what needs replacing, what needs re-testing on what cycle, and what can be monitored rather than immediately replaced.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Executive Summary for Management</h3>
          <p>
            Hospital administrators and quality managers rarely need — or have time for — the full technical findings. A concise executive summary translates the audit into what matters at the decision-making level: overall risk posture, top priorities, estimated remediation cost and timeline, and compliance status against NABH, CEA, and IS 17512 in language a non-engineer can act on.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Why the Roadmap Matters More Than the Report</h3>
          <p>
            An audit that stops at "here's what's wrong" leaves a hospital exactly where it started — aware of risk, but without a path to reducing it. The value is in the sequence: assessment, thermal and earthing data, prioritisation, compliance mapping, corrective actions, and a summary leadership can actually use to approve budget and timelines.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            JEF has delivered this structure across 16,000+ electrical and fire safety audits over 30+ years, for organizations across 30 countries, combining engineering assessment with a proprietary automated audit tool to keep findings consistent, documented, and traceable — audit after audit, not just once at commissioning.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            If your last audit produced a report and nothing else, it's worth asking what a roadmap-based audit would actually change.

          <h3 className="text-white font-bold mb-4 uppercase">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 flex flex-col gap-3">
            <li>
              <strong>What is included in a hospital electrical and fire safety audit report?</strong> A complete report includes a detailed asset assessment, thermal imaging findings, an earthing and lightning protection assessment, a risk prioritisation matrix, a compliance review against applicable standards (CEA 2023, NABH, IS 17512, NBCS 2026), specific corrective action recommendations, and an executive summary for management. A report missing any of these — especially the risk prioritisation matrix — gives findings without a way to act on them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How is an electrical safety audit different from a NABH inspection?</strong> NABH accreditation assesses a hospital's overall patient-safety and quality-management systems, of which electrical infrastructure reliability is one component. An electrical and fire safety audit is a focused technical assessment of that specific component — panels, earthing, lightning protection, backup power — that produces the evidence and corrective documentation a hospital would need to satisfy NABH's infrastructure-safety criteria, rather than replacing the broader accreditation process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>How often should a hospital conduct an electrical and fire safety audit?</strong> Most facilities benefit from a full audit annually, with more frequent partial checks (thermal imaging, backup power load tests) if the facility has added equipment, expanded floors, or hasn't had recent maintenance history reviewed. CEA 2023's inspection periodicities and NABH's reaccreditation cycles are useful minimum benchmarks, but a hospital with older infrastructure or recent load additions should audit more frequently than the regulatory minimum.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>What does NBCS 2026 change for hospital fire safety compliance?</strong> NBCS 2026 (National Building Construction Standards) replaced NBC 2016 in April 2026 and shifted several fire-safety provisions from mandatory ("shall") to advisory ("should") language at the national level, while raising the threshold for mandatory fire compliance to 24 metres and enabling vertical expansion for hospitals. Because fire safety enforcement now rests more heavily with state and municipal authorities, hospitals should confirm their local adoption status rather than assuming the national standard alone covers their obligations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Who should be involved when reviewing an electrical safety audit report?</strong> At minimum, the facilities/engineering team (for the technical findings and corrective actions), hospital administration or quality management (for the compliance mapping and executive summary), and finance or capital-planning stakeholders (for prioritising and budgeting remediation work). The risk prioritisation matrix is usually the bridge document that lets all three groups work from the same set of priorities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Is a one-time electrical audit enough, or does it need to be ongoing?</strong> A one-time audit gives you a snapshot, but earthing conditions, panel wear, and backup power reliability all change over time — which is exactly why CEA 2023 and NABH both build periodic reassessment into their frameworks rather than treating a single audit as sufficient. Ongoing, scheduled audits (annual, at minimum) are what actually keep a hospital's risk posture current rather than accurate only on the day the audit was performed.
