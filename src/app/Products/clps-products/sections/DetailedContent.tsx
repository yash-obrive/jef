        <p>Lightning causes two distinct categories of damage.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          The first is Direct physical damage. It occurs when strike current —
          ranging from a few kiloamperes to several hundred kiloamperes —
          travels through the building fabric, fuel or gas services, or nearby
          people, resulting in fire, structural damage, explosion, or loss of life.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The second is Indirect damage. It affects electrical and electronic systems.
          Even without direct contact, electromagnetic fields associated with the
          lightning channel induce transient overvoltages onto cables and conductors,
          destroying components, corrupting data, and causing hidden failures.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p>
          Modern facilities depend on electronic controls, communications, and data
          networks. The consequences of lightning damage to these systems extend well 
          beyond the cost of the damaged equipment — they include production downtime, 
          data loss, safety system unavailability, and regulatory non-compliance.
        </p>
        <br/>
        
        <p>
          A comprehensive lightning protection system addresses both: the external
          system intercepts direct strikes; the internal system manages overvoltages
          before they reach sensitive equipment.

          assessment that determines whether protection is required, through
          the physical design of the external system, to the protection of

          and neither is adequate on its own.

          The external system manages the direct strike. It intercepts lightning
          at the air termination, routes current through the down conductors and
          disperses energy to ground via the earth termination — protecting the
          structure from physical damage, fire, and dangerous touch and step
          voltages.

        < br/>
        <p>
          The internal system manages the electrical consequences within the
          building. It uses Equipotential bonding to eliminate dangerous
          potential differences between LPS conductors and metallic services and
          structural elements inside the building. Surge Protective Devices
          installed on all electrical and electronic lines limit transient
          overvoltages — from strikes or internal switching — to levels
          equipment can safely withstand.
